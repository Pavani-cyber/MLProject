*Project Overview
Employee burnout has become a significant concern in organizations. This project analyzes multiple factors (workload, mental fatigue, work hours, job satisfaction, etc.) and uses a regression model to predict burnout scores.

The goal is to help companies identify employees at risk and take preventive measures.
