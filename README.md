#Project Overview<br>
Employee burnout has become a significant concern in organizations. This project analyzes multiple factors (workload, mental fatigue, work hours, job satisfaction, etc.)<br> and uses a regression model to predict burnout scores.
<br>
The goal is to help companies identify employees at risk and take preventive measures.<br>
